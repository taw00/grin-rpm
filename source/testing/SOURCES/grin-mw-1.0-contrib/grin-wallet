# Wrapper script for the grin cryptocurrency wallet funcionality.
#
# grin-wallet executes "grin wallet" out of the /var/lib/grin/ directory.
#
#
# Why does this exist? Because in the linux ecosystem, "grin" has been used by
# a python project for a very long time and therefore there is a namespace
# clash. You can find that project here: https://pypi.org/project/grin/

/var/lib/grin/grin wallet $@
